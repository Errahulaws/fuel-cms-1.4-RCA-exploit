# Fuel CMS 1.4.1 - Remote Code Execution Exploit (CVE-2018-16763)

This repository contains two Python scripts for exploiting the Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Fuel CMS 1.4.1 (CVE-2018-16763). Both scripts allow for executing commands on the target system, one using a proxy (for tools like Burp Suite) and another that directly interacts with the vulnerable system without a proxy.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library: Install using `pip install requests`

## Usage


#### Running the Script

1. Ensure Burp Suite or another HTTP proxy is running on `127.0.0.1:8080`. (In case you are using proxy script)
2. Execute the script by running:

    ```bash
    python3 fuelcms_rce_proxy.py
    ```

3. Make sure to update the `url` value in the script with your target IP
